This memory game is a personal hobby project built to practice my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Scores and times are saved in your browser's local storage and are linked to the player name you provide. Each new score replaces the previous one — there's no tracking of personal bests or fastest times currently.

I hope you find the game both fun and a bit challenging—especially when hunting for trios!
